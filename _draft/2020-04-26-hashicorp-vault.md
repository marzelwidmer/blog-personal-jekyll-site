# HashiCorp Vault for OpenShift
There is a nice OpenShift HashiCorp Vault standalone installation description form [Open Lab Red Hat](https://github.com/openlab-red) where I was playing around with my `OKD` cluster on `Hetzner Cloud`.
There is also a older Blog post from me [hetzner-okd](http://blog.marcelwidmer.org/hetzner-okd/). 

Let's start with the standalon installation from the [README.md](https://github.com/openlab-red/hashicorp-vault-for-openshift/blob/master/vault/standalone/README.md)
